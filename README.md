# flask_todo
Simple todo app using python and flask.

This is simple todo app where you add your tasks in to do list and after completing them you marked them as complete.
There tons of todo list app in market then what's new with this app?
This app is not for commercial use. Todo list app is always great way to start when you are learning new technology in software development, its like hello world program of web or app development.
Just like that I made this app to start my journey in web development using flask, in which I learnt about basic of flask, how to create database, basic CRUD operations, how to render html pages etc. 
There is lot more in flask and overall web development, but after I complete this app, I gain some confidence to atleast start any web developent project
